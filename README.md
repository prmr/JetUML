# JetUML
A desktop application for fast UML diagramming. The idea of JetUML is to support the diagramming of software design ideas *with a minimum of fuss*. With about 60 seconds of practice the tool should be faster to use than a white board. No installation is required and with a 400Kb footprint, the application can easily be added to a project's resource directory. Diagrams can be saved in JSON, exported to popular image formats, and copied to the system clipboard for seamless integration with other tools.
