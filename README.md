A lightweight desktop application for interactively creating and editing diagrams in the Unified Modeling Language. JetUML supports the sketching of software design ideas with a minimum of fuss. Diagrams can be saved in JSON, exported to popular image formats, and copied to the system clipboard for integration with other tools. Supports class diagrams, sequence diagrams, state diagrams, object diagrams, and use case diagrams.

## Endorsements

> I do a fair bit of modeling with some commercial tools which can be quite heavyweight. Whenever I need to quickly sketch out a design before writing code I prefer JetUML in most cases.
