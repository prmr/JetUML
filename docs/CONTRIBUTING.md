## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [JetUML code of conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). 
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Reporting Bugs

If you think you have discovered a problem with JetUML, please proceed as follows:

1. Make sure you are using the **[most recent release](https://github.com/prmr/JetUML/releases)**. 
2. **Search the [list of issues](https://github.com/prmr/JetUML/issues)** (both open and closed) to see if your issue might have been reported already.
3. After you have determined that your issue is undocumented, **[create a new issue report](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/)**, using "Bug Report" as the issue template.
4. Give your report the most specific title you can think of that properly describes the problem.
5. Select the label `bug` (blue tag). Leave the rest of the issue attributes empty.
6. Complete the bug report.
7. Click "Submit new issue".

Issue reports in the JetUML project are tagged according to the following system:

* **Blue** tags indicate the **type of issue**, namely whether the issue report documents a bug, requests a feature, suggests a refactoring, etc.
* **Green** tags indicate the area of the project that is targeted by the report: test, main (production code), configuration files and resources, etc.
* **Red** tags draw attention to certain issue reports, e.g., to flag them as questions, of issues that can use extra help.
* **Gray** tags indicate a problem with the issue report itself.

## Contributing Minor Fixes

If you would like to contribute a *minor fix*, you can directly submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests) for it. A minor fix is a code change that is very short (a few lines maximum), typically located in a single place, and that has a well-isolated impact (i.e., does not require changing anything else). Examples of minor fixes include:

* Corrections of typos or inconsistencies in the documentation; 
* Small, localized bug fixes;
* Localized code improvements;
 
## Tackling Bigger Changes
 
 If you are considering contributing more than a minor fix, please comment on the corresponding issue first to share your ideas.
