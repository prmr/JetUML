/**
 *  Supplies convenience implementations for a number of methods
 *  in the Edge interface. In particular, the class implements
 *  support for "containment testing" of edges, i.e., testing
 *  whether a point falls on a edge. This is done by obtaining 
 *  the shape of the edge and stroking it with a fat stroke.
 *  NOTE: Ideally, you should be able to draw the same shape that
 *  is used for containment testing. However, in JDK 1.4, 
 *  BasicStroke.createStrokedShape returned shitty-looking shapes,
 *  so drawing the stroked shapes should be visually tested for 
 *  each edge type.
