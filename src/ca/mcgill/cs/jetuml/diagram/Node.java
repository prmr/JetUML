/**
 * A node in a diagram.
 * 
 * Different node subclasses can potentially implement the 
 * child node and parent mixin behavior, depending on the needs
 * of the diagram type in which nodes participants.
 * 
 * Nodes that can act as child nodes can potentially be linked to a parent node. 
 * 
 * Nodes that can act as parent nodes can potentially have children nodes according 
 * to a diagram type-specific parent-child relation. Parent nodes control their
 * child nodes. If a child node has a parent, only the parent node is tracked by
 * the diagram object. If a parent node is removed from the diagram, all its children
 * are also removed. Cloning a parent node clones all the children, and similarly
 * with all other operations, including copying, translating, etc.
