This will enable a rubber band view of the start and end nodes for the edge. Release the mouse on the destination edge to complete the operation. Edges are laid out automatically: to control their path it is necessary to move their start and end nodes. The edge creation operation will not have any effect if the edge type is not a valid way to connect the selected nodes." },
