    { "text": "In JetUML diagrams have a fixed size. To change this size, use the menu command View | Set Diagram Size. The size will be used when creating new diagrams or opening diagram files. When opening a diagram, the size is automatically increased to fit the diagram if necessary. Larger diagrams decrease the tool's performance. The default values are in relation to the display size." },
